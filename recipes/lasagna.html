        <h2>Lasagna</h2>
        
        <p class="desc">This guacamole recipe gets a tasty kick from cayenne and cilantro. 
            When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to All recipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. <br>
            One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and <br>
            has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, 
            John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old — read all about his life and legacy here.

            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li> 
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>                
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>                
            <li>½ cup diced onion </li>                
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>                
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>                
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>These are steps we do to make guacamole</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, <br>
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. <br>
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, 
                and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            </p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
            <li>Step 7</li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
            </p>
            <li>Step 8</li>
            <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </ol>
