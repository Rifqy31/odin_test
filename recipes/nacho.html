        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>These are steps we do to make guacamole</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven broiler. Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. 
                Stir in water and taco seasoning mix; simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet. 
                Top with Cheddar cheese, then dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Top nachos with olives, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and jalapeño peppers.
            </p>
